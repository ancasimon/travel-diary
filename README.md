# travel-diary

This was a bonus project I tackled during our spring break. 

Project instructions can be found here: https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/MODULES_travel_diary.md.

## Feature List
1. In the Destinations section, users can view a list of destinations they want to visit and their details, including name, image, and description. 
1. Users can add new destinations. 
1. In the Diary section, users can see the diary entires they made in the past when visited some of these sites.
1. When users get to visit one of their destinations anew or again, they can enter their impressions about the experience in the input text field on that card and submit them, which automatically creates a diary entry in their Diary section. 
1. The diary entry displays the name of the location from the card, a timestamp, and the comments the user entered.
1. Newest diary entries appear at the bottom. 
1. Once a user has written about a place at least once, the color of the card changes from a light tan background to a dark green backgroudn to indicate they made it there.
1. Users can delete diary entries.
1. Users can edit their diary entries.
